# JavaScript Games: Tetris & Puzzle

Just for practice when I was starting to learn Javascript 4 years ago. The two games were finished in 7 days.

1st Jun, 2014: began to learn Javascript ABC ...
7th Jun, 2014: done.

As a beginner, I didn't know JQuery at that time, and just implemented them by PURE JAVASCRIPT. 
* NO JQUERY
* NO LESS/SASS/SCSS
* NO Typescript 
* NO ANY FRAMEWORK

Sounds so stupid ...

Maybe rewrite them in typescript later .. MAYBE
